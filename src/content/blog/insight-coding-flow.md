I used to think of code reviews as quality gates - something to catch bugs before they ship.

But they're really just pair programming spread across time. The reviewer becomes your temporary pair, and your code becomes the conversation.

This reframe changed everything:
- I write more descriptive commit messages (setting context for my "pair")
- I break down complex changes into smaller, reviewable chunks
- I ask specific questions in PR descriptions instead of just saying "please review"

The best code reviews feel like a conversation between two people solving a problem together. The only difference is that conversation happens in GitHub comments instead of at the same desk.
