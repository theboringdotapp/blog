Traditional blogs feel too formal for the way I actually think and learn. The pressure to write a "complete" post often stops me from sharing anything at all.

What if instead of posts, I had a timeline? Quick thoughts, learnings, and longer pieces all mixed together chronologically. More like Twitter but without the character limit and with better context.

The timeline becomes a record of thinking, not just finished thoughts.
