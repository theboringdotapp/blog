Used Claude to help debug a React state issue today. Instead of spending 2 hours going through Stack Overflow, I described the problem in plain English and got a solution in minutes.

The interesting part wasn't the solution itself - it's how the AI made me articulate the problem better. Sometimes rubber duck debugging needs a rubber duck that talks back.
