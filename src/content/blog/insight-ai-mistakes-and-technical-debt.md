As I'm thinking about the project while I'm vibe coding it, I'm having to re-do a lot of features. I wonder if I could re-do these small projects with a single prompt, based on the final version. 

This could help me get rid of unused code or mess that was generated. Maybe I could summarize all prompts saved by [specstory](https://specstory.com/) to come up with a final prompt.
