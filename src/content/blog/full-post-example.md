Building software has never been more accessible, yet the landscape feels more competitive than ever. Over the past few months, I've been experimenting with a new approach: using AI as a coding partner to build micro-SaaS applications rapidly without sacrificing quality.

## The Philosophy Behind theboring.app

The name says it all - these aren't revolutionary apps that will change the world. They're boring, useful tools that solve specific problems. The beauty lies in their simplicity and the speed at which they can be brought to life.

### Why "Boring" Works

1. **Clear Problem Definition**: Boring problems are usually well-defined problems
2. **Faster Validation**: Simple concepts are easier to test with users
3. **Focused Development**: Limited scope means fewer distractions

## The AI-Assisted Development Process

My workflow has evolved to leverage AI at every stage:

### 1. Idea Validation
Instead of spending weeks researching, I can quickly prototype ideas and get them in front of users within days.

### 2. Code Generation
AI handles the boilerplate, I focus on the unique logic and user experience.

### 3. Documentation
AI helps maintain consistent documentation as the codebase evolves.

## Lessons Learned

After building several projects this way, here are the key insights:

- **Speed vs. Understanding**: Moving fast is great, but you still need to understand what you're building
- **AI as a Junior Developer**: Treat AI suggestions like code review from a junior developer - helpful but requires oversight
- **User Feedback is King**: No amount of AI assistance replaces real user feedback

## What's Next

The goal is to continue this experiment, documenting both successes and failures. Each project teaches something new about the intersection of AI and product development.

*This is just the beginning.*
