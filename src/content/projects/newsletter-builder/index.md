summary: |
  I thought it would be a good idea to start saving the links for the articles, news and products that I find interesting. So what if I could convert these links into a newsletter? This simple tool helps me do that, with minimal effort.

  It is highly tailored to my needs, so might not be useful for anybody else right now.

A streamlined AI-powered newsletter builder that helps create weekly newsletters by saving interesting links throughout the week and using AI to generate cohesive, polished content with minimal manual effort.

## Features

**Smart link curation**: Save interesting links as you discover them with automatic AI-generated titles and summaries, organized by categories (Tools, Models, Articles, Other) and stored securely in your GitHub repository.

**Drag-and-drop newsletter building**: Review saved links, reorder them with intuitive drag-and-drop interface, add personal insights, and let AI generate cohesive newsletter content with consistent formatting and structure.

**Multiple export options**: Direct Kit.com integration for one-click newsletter publishing, JSON download for any email platform, or clipboard copy for manual pasting into any editor or system.

**Intelligent archiving system**: Automatically archive used links after newsletter export to maintain a clean workspace while preserving historical data in organized month-based repository structure.

## Architecture

Built with **Next.js** and **React** for responsive user interface, featuring settings-based configuration that eliminates environment file complexity. **GitHub API** integration provides secure link storage with automatic repository organization.

**AI content pipeline** leverages **OpenAI API** for automatic link summarization and newsletter generation, while **Kit.com API** enables seamless newsletter publishing without manual copying or formatting.

**File-based data organization** structures content in logical hierarchy with monthly link storage, weekly newsletter archives, and clean separation between active and archived content for optimal workflow management.

## Technical implementation

**Frontend**: Next.js with React components, TypeScript for type safety, and responsive design for optimal link management and newsletter building experience across all devices.

**API integrations**: GitHub API for repository-based storage, OpenAI for AI content generation and summarization, and Kit.com for direct newsletter publishing with proper error handling and authentication.

**Data management**: Organized file structure with JSON-based storage, automatic archiving workflows, and intelligent content categorization for efficient newsletter creation and historical tracking.

The tool demonstrates how AI can transform tedious content curation into an efficient workflow, making newsletter creation accessible while maintaining high-quality output and professional formatting for consistent audience engagement.
