    An experimental app that combines storytelling with AI-generated music.
    
    The idea is to create short, engaging stories where the background music adapts to the narrative mood and pacing.
    
    Still figuring out the best way to sync music tempo with story beats.

An experimental storytelling platform that combines AI-generated narratives with dynamically composed background music to create immersive audio-visual experiences.

## Current Concept

**Adaptive music composition**: Stories are analyzed for emotional tone, pacing, and narrative structure to generate complementary background scores that evolve with the plot progression.

**Interactive story generation**: Users provide themes, genres, or prompts, and the system creates multi-part stories with synchronized musical accompaniment that matches the narrative mood.

**Mood-based orchestration**: Different story elements (tension, romance, action, mystery) trigger corresponding musical styles and instruments for enhanced emotional impact.

## Technical Challenges

**Audio-text synchronization**: Developing algorithms to match story pacing with musical tempo and ensuring smooth transitions between different musical themes.

**Real-time composition**: Generating coherent musical pieces that maintain consistency while adapting to story developments without jarring transitions.

**Performance optimization**: Managing audio file generation and streaming for smooth playback without disrupting the reading experience.

## Architecture Plans

**Frontend**: Web-based story reader with embedded audio player, progress visualization, and interactive controls for pace adjustment.

**Backend**: Story generation pipeline integrated with music composition APIs, with caching layers for generated content.

**AI Integration**: Combining narrative AI models with music generation services, potentially using Suno API for audio creation.

The project explores how AI can enhance traditional storytelling through multi-sensory experiences, potentially opening new formats for digital narrative content.
